# Kinoteka Kalendar
Parser for the [Yugoslav film archive](http://www.kinoteka.org.rs/) monthly program, data from [danubeogradu.rs](https://danubeogradu.rs)

The program the YFA releases is in a PDF and split by location, so you can't see screenings for a specfic date. My app shows the program in a neat, readable table with links to the [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) page for the film.

The app is live on my website at [kinoteka.lazic.xyz](https://kinoteka.lazic.xyz)

# kinoteka kalendar
parser for the [Yugoslav film archive](http://www.kinoteka.org.rs/) monthly program, data from [danubeogradu.rs](https://danubeogradu.rs)

the app is now live on my website at [kinoteka.lazic.xyz](https://kinoteka.lazic.xyz)

i have tested it for all the screenings from this year including may (the ones from before then are in a different format).

the reason i didn't directly scrape from the YFA PDF they post every month is because the format was too difficult for me to work with and isn't consistent.

the format on danubeogradu.rs, while still not perfectly consistent, was consistent enough for me to succesfully scrape the screenings from this year.
i can only hope the format doesn't change further. maybe i'll get in contact with the guy who writes the programs and ask him to keep a regular format.

i was also thinking of contacting the YFA directly and asking them for a more parseable file, but that doesn't seem likely to get a response.
